# LatexFiles
Alex Hahn's Latex Files, Enjoy ^^

These are a collection of Headers (.tex files containg what packages to include, custom short cuts, and many other items that make LaTeX what it is), Outlines ( .texfiles that call a Header, then give you the skeleton of the .tex file that you will write on and compile, note don't write directly ontop of the Header or Outline files, copy the Outline file to the name of the file that you are creating ^^), and test .tex files to test and give you a hint of what the final results of various headers and Outlines may look like.
